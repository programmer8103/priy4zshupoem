girl, please understand this
a man raised by parents
is different from a man raised by absence.

a man shaped by a father
carries discipline in his silence.
a man shaped by a mother
learns love before he learns strength.

a man raised by a big brother
walks faster, tougher,
with bruises turned into lessons.

a man raised by a sister
learns gentleness early,
learns how words can heal or harm.
(a truth i hv only gathered from the stories of my brothers) 

​a man raised by a grandfather
holds respect like a compass,
he values the work of his hands
and the weight of a kept promise.

​a man raised by a grandmother
carries an old soul’s patience.
he knows that some things
only grow with time and prayer.

a man raised by a friend he never met 
learns to see with his heart, not his eyes. 
he discovers that a voice from afar 
can build a home inside his mind. 

​a man raised by his friends
learns loyalty in the trenches,
finding a brotherhood
that the world couldn't give him.

and a man raised by the woman who will be his wife 
learns that his story is still being written. 
she teaches him that to be truly known 
is the greatest strength of all. 

​a man raised by the pavement
develops eyes that never sleep,
he learns to read the wind
before he learns to trust the path.
(if your "upbringing" happened outside the house with friends or mentors)

​a man raised by his own reflection
builds a house with no blueprints,
he learns to be his own light
when the world turns dark and quiet.
(self made man )

every home leaves fingerprints.
every voice becomes an echo inside him.
so when you try to read a man,
don’t judge only his actions
listen to the childhood
that taught him how to feel.

his nature is not random.
it is a story written by
who stayed,
who left,
and who raised him
in the world around him.
